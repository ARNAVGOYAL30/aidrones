                <p class="ai-para"><strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)</strong> is the ability of a computer or a robot
                    controlled by a
                    computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and
                    discernment, or we can say that it is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks
                    that normally require human intelligence. Like Speech recognition, decision-making, visual
                    perception. Artificial intelligence systems works by algorithms, using techniques such as machine
                    learning, deep learning and rules. Machine learning algorithms feed computer data to AI systems,
                    using statistical techniques to enable AI systems to learn. Through machine learning, AI systems get
                    progressively better at tasks, without having specific program to do so.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-types">TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
                <ul class="ul-types-ai">
                    <li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</li>
                    <li>Artificial General Intelligence</li>
                    <li>Artificial Super Intelligence</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Artificial Narrow Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="ai-para"><strong>ARTIFICIAL NARROW INTELLIGENCE (ANI)</strong> is a specific type of
                    artificial intelligence in
                    which goal-oriented & learning algorithm is designed to perform a singular task, and any knowledge
                    gained from performing that task will not automatically be applied to other tasks. Example- facial
                    recognition, speech recognition/voice assistants, driving a car, or searching the internet
                    Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), also referred to as weak AI or narrow AI. Narrow intelligence
                    doesn’t mimic or replicate human intelligence, it merely simulates human behaviour based on a narrow
                    range of parameters and contexts.<br><br>

                    Narrow AI’s machine intelligence comes from the use of natural language processing (NLP) to perform
                    tasks. NLP is evident in chatbots and similar AI technologies by understanding speech and text in
                    natural language. AI is programmed to interact with humans in a natural, personalized manner.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>ARTIFICIAL NARROW INTELLIEGENCE (ANI)</strong> can either be reactive or have limited
                    memory. Reactive AI is
                    incredibly basic because it has no memory or data storage capabilities or better than the human
                    mind’s ability to respond the different kinds of instigation without prior experience. Limited
                    memory AI is more advanced, equipped with data storage and learning capabilities that enable
                    machines to use historical data to inform decisions.
                    <br><br>
                    Every sort of machine intelligence that surrounds us today is Narrow AI. Some examples of narrow AI
                    are Google Assistant, Google Translate, Siri and other natural language processing tools. Sometimes
                    we call these as “weak” because they can’t think by themselves. They lack the self-awareness,
                    consciousness and genuine intelligence to match human intelligence.
                </p>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="ai-para"><strong>ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (AGI)</strong> is a concept of the machine
                    with general
                    intelligence that could carry out any task a human could, and likely many that a human couldn't. At
                    the very least, an AGI would be able to combine human-like, flexible thinking and reasoning with
                    computational advantages, such as near-instant recall and split-second number crunching. ARTIFICIAL
                    GENERAL INTELLIGENCE(AGI) is also called strong AI or deep AI.<br><br>

                    Strong AI uses the theory of mind AI framework not to replicate or simulate, it’s about training
                    machines to understand humans to differentiate needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes of
                    other intelligent entitles. Theory of mind level AI is not about replication or simulation, it’s
                    about training machines to truly understand humans.
                    <br><br>
                    Using this intelligence to control robots at least as versed and mobile as a person would result in
                    a new breed of machines that could perform any human task. Over time these intelligences would be
                    able to take over every role performed by humans. Initially, humans working alongside AI might be
                    more effective than AI on their own. But the advantage of AGI would likely render human labour
                    obsolete.
                    <br><br>
                    The ability to employ an army of intelligences equal to the best and brightest humans could help
                    develop new technologies and approaches for mitigating intractable problems such as climate change.
                    On a more mundane level, such systems could perform everyday tasks, from surgery and medical
                    diagnosis to driving cars, at a consistently higher level than humans -- which in aggregate could be
                    a huge positive in terms of time, money and lives saved.
                    <br><br>
                    Strong artificial intelligence is more of a philosophy rather than an actual approach to creating
                    AI. It is a different perception of AI wherein it equates AI to humans. It stipulates that a
                    computer can be programmed to actually be a human mind, to be intelligent in every sense of the
                    word, to have perception, beliefs and have other cognitive states that are normally only ascribed to
                    humans.
                    <br><br>
                    Fujitsu-built K, one of the fastest supercomputers, is one of the most notable attempts at achieving
                    strong AI, but considering it took 40 minutes to simulate a single second of neural activity. It is
                    difficult to determine whether or not strong AI will be achieved in our foreseeable future. As image
                    and facial recognition technology advances, it is likely we will see an improvement in the ability
                    of machines to learn and see.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-types">Artificial Super Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="ai-para"><strong>ARTIFICIAL SUPER INTELLIGENCE(ASI)</strong> is the hypothetical AI that
                    doesn’t just mimic or
                    understand human intelligence and behaviour; ASI is where machines become self-aware and surpass the
                    capacity of human intelligence and ability.
                    <br><br>
                    The concept of artificial super intelligence see AI evolve to be so akin to human emotions and
                    experiences, that it doesn’t just understand them, it evokes emotions, needs, beliefs and desires of
                    its own.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to replicating the multi-faceted intelligence of human beings, ASI would theoretically
                    be exceedingly better at everything we do; math, science, sports, art, medicine, hobbies, emotional
                    relationships, everything. ASI would have a greater memory and a faster ability to process and
                    analyse data and stimulation. Consequently, the decision-making and problem solving capabilities of
                    super intelligent beings would be far superior than those of human beings.
                    <br><br>
                    The potential of having such powerful machines at our disposal may seem appealing, but the concept
                    itself has a multitude of unknown consequences. If self-aware super intelligent beings came to be,
                    they would be capable of ideas like self-preservation. The impact this will have on humanity, our
                    survival, and our way of life, is pure speculation.
                    <br><br>
                    With Super intelligence, machines can think of the possible abstractions which are simply impossible
                    for humans to think. This is because the human brain has a limit to the thinking ability which is
                    constrained to some billion neurons.
                    <br><br>
                    ASI would have a better memory and be able to process and understand circumstances, data, and
                    stimulus acts more quickly. As a result, we may be confident that super-intelligent machine’s
                    decision-making and problem-solving capabilities will be far superior and precise to those of
                    humans.

                <h2 class="heading-types">Reactive Machines</h2>
                <p class="ai-para">The reactive machine type is the most basic variety of AI. It merely reacts to
                    current scenarios and cannot rely on upon taught or recalled data to make decisions in the present.
                    Reactive machines do away with maps and other forms of pre-planning altogether and focus on live
                    observations of the environment. They are given specific tasks and don’t have capabilities beyond
                    those duties.<br><br>

                    They’re what you’re most likely to see when witnessing a robot playing a game, like chess, against a
                    human. But reactive machines don’t interact with the world, so they respond to identical situations
                    in the same ways every time those scenarios are encountered. These AI systems have no memory and are
                    task specific. An example is Deep Blue; Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard and make
                    predictions, but because it has no memory. It cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
                    <br><br>
                    The most basic but still quite useful artificial intelligence is called reactive AI because it
                    reacts to existing conditions as its name suggests. Deep Blue, the supercomputer created by IBM in
                    the 1980s that ultimately competed and won a chess match against reigning world champion Garry
                    Kasparov, is a notable example of reactive AI. Reactive AI functions the way it was programmed with
                    a predictable output based on the input it receives. These reactive machines will respond to
                    identical situations in the exact same way every time. There will never be a variance in action if
                    the input is the same. Reactive machines aren’t able to learn or conceive of the past or future.
                    Some examples of reactive AI are Spam filters and the Netflix recommendation engine.
                </p><br>
                <h2 class="heading-types">Limited Memory Machines</h2>
                <p class="ai-para">limited memory is characterized by the ability to absorb learning data and improve
                    over time based on its experience similar to the way the human brain’s neurons connect. limited
                    memory AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions.
                    <br><br>
                    Limited memory AI can complete complex classification tasks and uses historical data to make
                    predictions. Self-driving cars use limited memory AI because the algorithms that power these
                    vehicles use data they were trained and programmed on to understand how to operate but can also
                    interpret data it observes to read its environment and adjust when necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    The reaction time of autonomous vehicles improved significantly with limited memory AI, an important
                    result that makes them safer on public roads. Limited Memory machines can retain data for a short
                    period of time. While they can use this data for a specific period of time, they cannot add it to a
                    library of their experiences.
                    <br><br>
                    Many self-driving cars use Limited Memory technology: they store data such as the recent speed of
                    nearby cars, the distance of such cars, the speed limit, and other information that can help them
                    navigate roads.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-types">Theory Of Mind</h2>
                <p class="ai-para">Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means that the system
                    would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer
                    human intentions and predict behaviour, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members
                    of human teams.
                    <br><br>
                    An important aspect of this AI is that machines would have the capability to understand and remember
                    emotions and adjust behaviour based on those emotions just as humans can in social interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    Although theory of mind AI has not been fully achieved, the robots Kismet (introduced in 2000) and
                    Sophia (2016) showed some aspects of this type of AI. Kismet recognized emotions and could replicate
                    them through its facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, lips and ears.
                    <br><br>
                    Sophia, a humanoid robot, along with her human-like likeness was also able to “see” emotions and
                    respond appropriately. One of the hurdles machines will have in achieving theory of mind AI is that
                    they would have to rapidly shift behaviour based on emotions to mimic how fluid this process is in
                    human communication.

                <h2 class="heading-types">Self-Aware AI</h2>
                <p class="ai-para">AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with
                    self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist. This will be
                    when machines are not only aware of emotions and mental states of others, but also their own.
                    <br><br>
                    Self-aware AI involves machines that have human-level consciousness. This form of AI is not
                    currently in existence, but would be considered the most advanced form of artificial intelligence
                    known to man.
                    <br><br>
                    When self-aware AI is achieved we would have AI that has human-level consciousness and equals human
                    intelligence with the same needs, desires and emotions. At the moment, this AI hasn’t been developed
                    successfully yet because we don’t have the hardware or algorithms that will support it.
