                <h2 class="ml-heading">MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science
                    which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually
                    improving its accuracy.<br><br>

                    Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of
                    statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key
                    insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within
                    applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.</p>

                <h2 class="ml-heading">IMPORTANCE OF MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in
                    customer behaviour and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new
                    products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine
                    learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive
                    differentiator for many companies.</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="ml-heading">WORKING IN MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">The learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts:</p>
                <ul class="ul-types-ml">
                    <li><strong>Decision Process:</strong> Machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or
                        classification.
                        Based on some input data, which can be labelled or unlabelled, your algorithm will produce an
                        estimate about a pattern in the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Function:</strong> An Error Function serves to evaluate the prediction of the
                        model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the
                        accuracy of the model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Optimization Process:</strong> If the model can fit better to the data points in
                        the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example
                        and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating
                        weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="ml-heading">METHODS OF MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Machine learning classifies into three categories:</p>
                <ul class="ul-types-ml">
                    <li>Supervised machine learning</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised machine learning</li>
                    <li>Semi-supervised learning</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Supervised Machine Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Supervised learning is also known as supervised machine learning. It is defined by
                    its use of labelled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes
                    accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been
                    fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model
                    avoids overfitting or underfitting.
                    <br><br>
                    Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as
                    classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning
                    include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, support
                    vector machine (SVM) and more.<br><br>

                <h2 class="system-classification-heading">Working Of Supervised Machine Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Supervised machine learning requires the data scientist to train the algorithm with
                    both labelled
                    inputs and desired outputs. Supervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks:

                <ul class="ul-types-system-classification">
                    <li><strong>Binary classification:</strong> Dividing data into two categories.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Regression modelling:</strong> Predicting continuous values.</li>

                        produce an accurate prediction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning. It uses machine
                    learning algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabelled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden
                    patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover
                    similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data
                    analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, image and pattern recognition. It’s also
                    used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction;
                    principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches
                    for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means
                    clustering, probabilistic clustering methods, and more.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Working Of Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require data to be labelled. They
                    sift through
                    unlabelled data to look for patterns that can be used to group data points into subsets. Most types
                    of deep learning, including neural networks, are unsupervised algorithms. Unsupervised learning
                    algorithms are good for the following tasks:</p>
                <ul class="ul-types-advantage">
                    <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Splitting the dataset into groups based on similarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anomaly detection:</strong> Identifying unusual data points in a data set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Association mining:</strong> Identifying sets of items in a data set that frequently
                        occur together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dimensionality reduction:</strong> Reducing the number of variables in a data set.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2 class="heading-types">Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Semi-supervised learning offers a medium between supervised and unsupervised
                    learning. During training, it uses a smaller labelled data set to guide classification and feature
                    extraction from a larger, unlabelled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of
                    having not enough labelled data to train a supervised learning algorithm.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Working Of Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Semi-supervised learning works by data scientists feeding a small amount of labelled
                    training data to an algorithm. From this, the algorithm learns the dimensions of the data set, which
                    it can then apply to new, unlabelled data. The performance of algorithms typically improves when
                    they train on labelled data sets. But labelling data can be time consuming and expensive.
                    Semi-supervised learning strikes a middle ground between the performance of supervised learning and
                    the efficiency of unsupervised learning. Some areas where semi-supervised learning is used include:
                </p>
                <ul class="ul-types-advantage">
                    <li><strong>Machine translation:</strong> Teaching algorithms to translate language based on less
                        than a full
                        dictionary of words.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud detection:</strong> Identifying cases of fraud when you only have a few positive
                        examples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Labelling data:</strong> Algorithms trained on small data sets can learn to apply data
                        labels to larger
                        sets automatically.</li>

                <h2 class="heading-types">REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Reinforcement machine learning is a behavioural machine learning model that is
                    similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns
                    as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop
                    the best recommendation or policy for a given problem. The system used reinforcement learning to
                    decide whether to attempt an answer which square to select on the board, and how much to wager
                    especially on daily doubles.
                </p><br>

                <h2 class="heading-types">Working Of Reinforcement Learning</h2>
                <p class="ml-para">Reinforcement learning works by programming an algorithm with a distinct goal and a
                    prescribed set of rules for accomplishing that goal. Data scientists also program the algorithm to
                    seek positive rewards which it receives when it performs an action that is beneficial toward the
                    ultimate goal and avoid punishments which it receives when it performs an action that gets it
                    farther away from its ultimate goal. Reinforcement learning is often used in areas such as:

                        speech-to-text. It
                        has capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to process human speech into a
                        written format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct
                        voice search—e.g. Siri—or provide more accessibility around texting.

                    <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer
                        journey. They
                        answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) around topics, like shipping, or provide personalized
                        advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users, changing the way we think about
                        customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Examples include messaging bots
                        on e-commerce sites with virtual agents, messaging apps, such as Slack and Facebook Messenger,

                        can take action. This ability to provide recommendations distinguishes it from image recognition
                        tasks. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications within photo
                        tagging in social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars within the
                        automotive industry.</li>
