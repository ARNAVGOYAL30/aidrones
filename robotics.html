        <h2 class="heading-types">ROBOTICS</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and
            operation of robots. It is an interdisciplinary sector focused on creating machines that efficiently carry
            out various tasks. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist
            humans in a variety of ways. Robotics can take on a number of forms. A robot may resemble a human, or it may
            be in the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation (RPA), which simulates how
            humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">Early History Of Robotics</h2>
        <h5 class="headerOfHistory">The term robotics is an extension of the word robot. One of its first uses came from Czech writer Karel
            Capek, who used the word in his play, Rossum's Universal Robots, in 1920. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
            have survived to the present:</h5>
        <ul class="ul-types">
            <li>Robots must never harm human beings.</li>
            <li>Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1.</li>
            <li>Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-types">Machine Learning In Robotics</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Machine learning and robotics intersect in a field known as robot learning. Robot learning
            is
            the study of techniques that enable a robot to acquire new knowledge or skills through machine learning
            algorithms. Some applications that have been explored by robot learning include grasping objects, object
            categorization and even linguistic interaction with a human peer. To learn, intelligent robots must
            accumulate facts through human input or sensors. Then, the robot's processing unit will compare the newly
            acquired data to previously stored information and predict the best course of action based on the data it
            has acquired.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">APPLICATIONS OF ROBOTICS</h2>
        <ul class="ul-types">
            <li>Helping fight forest fires</li>
            <li>Working alongside humans in manufacturing plants (known as co-bots)</li>
            <li>Robots that offer companionship to elderly individuals</li>
            <li>Surgical assistants</li>
            <li>Last-mile package and food order delivery</li>
            <li>Autonomous household robots that carry out tasks like vacuuming and mowing the grass</li>
            <li>Assisting with finding items and carrying them throughout warehouses</li>
            <li>Used during search-and-rescue missions after natural disasters</li>
            <li>Landmine detectors in war zones</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-types">ROBOTS</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">A robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that
            can
            assist humans or mimic human actions. Robots were originally built to handle monotonous tasks (like building
            cars on an assembly line), but have since expanded well beyond their initial uses to perform tasks like
            fighting fires, cleaning homes and assisting with incredibly intricate surgeries. Each robot has a differing
            level of autonomy, ranging from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks that a human has full control
            over to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-types">Main Components Of Robots</h2>
        <ul class="ul-types">
            <li>Control system</li>
            <li>Sensors</li>
            <li>Actuators</li>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <li>End Effectors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-types">1. Control System</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Computation includes all of the components that make up a robotâ€™s central processing unit,
            often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its
            specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order
            to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to
            assembly line packing.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">2. Sensors</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed
            by
            the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots
            include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate
            like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion
            based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">3. Actuators</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Actuators are the components that are responsible for the movement of frame and its body.
            These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to
            carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of
            materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic
            actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators,) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfil their specialized
            roles.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">4. Power Supply</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Robots requires power to work. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run
            on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots
            utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more
            compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all
            important factors to consider when designing a robotâ€™s power supply. Some potential power sources for future
            robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power,
            flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">5. End Effectors</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">End effectors are the external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their
            tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots
            may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for
            tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">Types Of Robots:</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Mechanical bots come in all shapes and sizes to efficiently carry out the task for which
            they
            are designed. All robots vary in design, functionality and degree of autonomy. There are five types of
            robots:</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">(i) Pre-Programmed Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous
            tasks. An example of a pre-programmed robot would be a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line. The
            arm serves one function to weld a door on, to insert a certain part into the engine, etc. and its job is to
            perform that task longer, faster and more efficiently than a human.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">(ii) Humanoid Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Humanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behaviour. These robots usually
            perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to
            look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Roboticsâ€™
            Sophia and Boston Dynamicsâ€™ Atlas.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">(iii) Autonomous Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. These robots are usually
            designed
            to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision. They are quite unique because
            they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures to take the
            optimal next step based on their data and mission. An example of an autonomous robot would be the Roomba
            vacuum cleaner, which uses sensors to roam freely throughout a home. Examples of autonomous robots: Cleaning
            Bots (for example, Roomba), Lawn Trimming Bots, Hospitality Bots, Autonomous Drones, Medical Assistant Bots
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">(iv) Teleoperated Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable human
            control from a safe distance. These robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather,
            circumstances, etc. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix
            underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">(v) Augmenting Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Augmenting robots either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a
            human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could
            become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making
            humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or
            exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">Software Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">A software robot is an abundant type of computer program which carries out tasks
            autonomously, such as a chatbot or a web crawler. However, because software robots only exist on the
            internet and originate within a computer, they are not considered robots. In order to be considered a robot,
            a device must have a physical form, such as a body or a chassis.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types" style="text-decoration:underline; margin-bottom: 25px;">Functioning Types Of Robots:</h2>
        <h2 class="heading-types">(a) Independent Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Independent robots are capable of functioning completely autonomously and independent of
            human operator control. These typically require more intense programming but allow robots to take the place
            of humans when undertaking dangerous, mundane or otherwise impossible tasks, from bomb diffusion and
            deep-sea travel to factory automation. Independent robots have proven to be the most disruptive to society,
            eliminating low-wage jobs but presenting new possibilities for growth.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-types">(b) Dependent Robots</h2>
        <p class="robo-para">Dependent robots are non-autonomous robots that interact with humans to enhance and
            supplement their already existing actions. This is a relatively new form of technology and is being
            constantly expanded into new applications, but one form of dependent robots that has been realized is
            advanced prosthetics that are controlled by the human mind.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-types">Characteristics Of Robots</h2>
        <ul class="ul-types" style="line-height: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Robots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction. The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it
                complete tasks in the environment for which itâ€™s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Roverâ€™s wheels are
                individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red
                planet.</li><br>
            <li>Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current
                (a battery, for example) is needed to power a large majority of robots.</li><br>
            <li>Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do,
                a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the
                ability to know when and how to carry out a task.</li><br>
