        <p class="spy-text">Spy Drones are used to surveillance the area, and send all the movement of the objects to
            the operator. It is mainly used by military (Army, Navy, Airforce) to detect location of the enemy, and
            their equipment’s. It is basically connecting with satellite system and provide information about enemies,
            army secret bases, air pads and naval bases. It also provides the movement of army and all the direction and
            roadmaps which they use to send their troops to the army bases. Spy Drones also provided the strength of
            troops near the border areas. Spy Drones are used in two ways, in first way human can see with their eyes
            and detect the drones and another way which are visible by human eyes but it can’t be detected because it is
            so small and made by using nano-technologies which has look like small insects, which has said by nano – spy
            drone. It is not compulsory that it is look in the shape of insects, it’s depend upon that, how would you
            designed it?</p>

        <h2 class="use-military">USES IN MILITARY</h2>
        <ul class="use-military-ul">
            <li>The Armed Forces use Spy Drones in both ways, but army mainly uses nano- spy drones near the border
                areas, because it can’t be detected by enemy easily. It’s help to recognise the exact location of the
                enemy.</li><br>
            <li>The Air-Forces use spy drones which are fly at the top height and can’t be detected by enemy radar, it’s
                because of it shapes and structure material used by the making of drones.</li><br>
            <li>The Naval Forces are also use spy drones in both ways, in first way the drones which are fly at the top
                height and can’t be detected by enemy radar, it’s because of it shapes and structure material used by
                the making of drones. And the second way it use nano- spy drones in their costal region, which can’t be
                detected by easily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="make-spy-heading">HOW TO MAKE SPY DRONES?</h2>
        <h5 class="make-spy-para">As you know that spy drones are of two types:</h5>
        <ul class="make-spy-ul">
            <li>Easily Visible & detected</li>
            <li>Visible & can’t detected</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="easily-visible-heading">EASILY VISIBLE & DETECTED</h2>
        <h5 class="easily-visible-para">To made this type of drones we need some specific material like:</h5>
        <ul class="easily-visible-ul">
            <li>Frame</li>
            <li>Power distribution board</li>
            <li>Battery</li>
            <li>Battery monitor</li>
            <li>Mounting pad</li>
            <li>Controller</li>

            <li>Camera</li>
            <li>RC transmitter and receiver</li>
            <li>USB key</li>
            <li>Motors: 4 motors are required</li>
            <li>An electric speed control for delivering power to the motor</li>
            <li>AWG silicon wire</li>
            <li>thread locking compound</li>
            <li>battery charger</li>
            <li>servo lead wire</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="construction-heading">CONSTRUCTION</h2>
        <ul class="construction-ul">
            <li>Construct a frame is the first thing to do in building your drone, which could be made with plastic,
                metal, or wood. If you are using wood, cut the wood board of about 70cm and 30-35mm thick and make an X-
                frame with the board.</li><br>
            <li>Drill some holes in the wooden frame to fit in the four motors using the distance which will allow free
                movement of the clip and shaft of the motor.</li><br>
            <li>After mounting the motors, you have to fix the speed controllers at the bottom side of the drone using
                zip ties then adding the land gear to reduce the risk of shock when landing the drone.</li><br>
            <li>The remote controller is needed to control the drone during flight, and various controllers are
                available nowadays, such as Flysky, Futaba, and so on.</li><br>
            <li>After choosing the right controller, you need to fix it on top of the frame in a straight direction for
                easy control.</li><br>
            <li>The camera should be mounted in a forward viewing position. An HD camera is a good fit for a clearer
                vision. The location of the camera is what makes the spying easy; the front of the drone is the best
                place to place the camera.</li><br>
            <li>Connect the battery to the lower part of the frame; the battery monitor should be fixed to and make sure
                it is tight so as not to fall off during flight.</li><br>
            <p class="construction-note">After fixing all the necessary materials, we have to test our drone to make
                sure that everything is working properly or not.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="visible-cant-heading">Visible & Can’t Detected</h2>
        <p class="visible-cant-para">This type of drones only made by Professionals because of its hard constructions,
            designing and advanced equipment’s used in nano-technologies to build it. To made this type of drones,
            firstly you should gain the knowledge about nano-technologies and their equipment’s, and learn how to use
            them? after that you will be able to make this type of drones. In this website we can’t tell you that how to
            make these types of drones because it’s break’s the privacy and can’t use in daily life. This type of drones
            used by military services and Professional use only.</p>

        <h2 class="easily-visible-heading">EASILY VISIBLE & DETECTED</h2>
        <p class="easily-visible-para">These types of drones fly the minimum height of the earth surface. There
            operational range only 1km - 5km where they work properly. And these types of drones carry small batteries
            which discharged by quickly. These types of drones are hard and able to stand with the temperature between
            -20 to 60 degrees Celsius. and there weight are very low and in the wind, it stand up to 50 knots.</p>

        <h2 class="visible-cannot-heading">VISIBLE & CAN’T DETECTED</h2>
        <p class="visible-cannot-para">These types of drones also fly the minimum height of the earth surface. There
            operational range only 0km - 2km where they work properly. And these types of drones carry very small
            batteries which discharged by quickly. These types of drones are pretty hard and able to stand with the
            temperatures between -10 to 43 degrees Celsius and there weight are very low and in the wind, it stand up to
